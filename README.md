TASK 5 : Food Recognition

This project aims to develop a model that accurately recognizes food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The model's objective is to enable users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices by providing calorie information for various food items. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset containing images of different food items along with their corresponding calorie values. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may be utilized to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The trained model will then be capable of accurately identifying a wide range of food items from images and providing users with estimated calorie values, empowering them to maintain a healthy diet and monitor their nutritional intake effectively
